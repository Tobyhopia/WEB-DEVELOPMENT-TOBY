    <P>
        <span class="pogs">Milk caps</span> is a children's game played with flat circular cardboard milk caps. Players
        make a stack of these
        caps, and take turns to drop a heavier "slammer" object onto it, causing the caps to be disrupted.
        Each player keeps any face-up caps and is to restack the face-down caps, repeating the process until none
        land face-down, at which point the player who collected the most caps wins the game of milk caps. The game is
        also known as Pogs, under which name it was sold commercially in the 1990s. The name originates from Pog, a
        brand of juice made from passionfruit, orange, and guava; the use of the juice's caps to play the game preceded
        the game's commercialization.

    <h2>HISTORY</h2>
    <hr>
    <P class="milkcaps">
        The game of <span class="pogs">milk caps</span> possibly originated in Maui, Hawaii, during the 1920s or
        1930s,[2][3] or possibly with
        origins in Menko, a Japanese card game very similar to milk caps, which has been in existence since the 17th
        century, during the Edo period.[4] The game of milk caps was played on the Hawaiian island of Maui as early as
        1927.[5][6][7] There are cap collectors that have caps dating back to the 1940s and 1950s.[8]

        After new packaging made cardboard milk caps obsolete in the 1950s, manufacturers such as Haleakala Dairy and
        Orchards Hawaii occasionally distributed the caps as promotional items.[8][9] When Haleakala used the caps to
        successfully promote the 1971 introduction of their fruit drink Pog, it led to a surge in similar promotions and
        milk cap collecting.[10][11] In 1991, Haleakala expanded to the more populated Oahu island, which led to a
        revival of the game. With this revival, the <span class="pogs">Pog</span> name began being used generically for
        the game.[8]

    <P class="milkcaps">
        The 1990s revival is credited to Blossom Galbiso, a teacher and guidance counselor who taught at Waialua
        Elementary School in Oahu. In 1991, Galbiso introduced the game she had played as a girl to a new generation of
        students, incorporating milk caps into her fifth grade curriculum as a way of teaching math and as a non-violent
        alternative to other popular schoolyard games, such as <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodgeball">dodgeball</a>.[5] The game spread from Oahu's North Shore,
        and by early 1992, Stanpac Inc., a Canadian packaging company that had been manufacturing the milk caps
        distributed by Haleakala Dairy on Maui (the same caps that were collected by Galbiso for her class), was
        printing millions of <span class="pogs">milk caps</span> every week for shipment to the Hawaiian island chain.
        The game spread to the
        mainland, first surfacing in California, Texas, Oregon, and Washington before spreading to the rest of the
        country. By 1993, the previously obscure game of <span class="pogs">milk caps</span>, which had almost been
        forgotten, was played
        throughout the world.[12]
    </P>
    <P class="milkcaps">
        Because many children would keep the milk caps they won in games from other players, many school districts
        considered milk caps a form of gambling.[4][15] Milk caps proved to be major distractions from classes and the
        source of various playground arguments. These elements eventually led to the banning of milk caps from various
        schools across North America.[15][16] Other bannings occurred across Australia and Sweden.[17][18]

    <H2>EQUIPMENT</H2>
    <hr>
    <P>
        <span> Milk caps generally involves two types of playing discs: milk caps and slammers. Milk caps are typically
            flat
            circular cardboard discs which are decorated with images on one or both sides. Traditional (or
            traditional-style) milk caps are made of rougher cardboard, are printed with limited colors, and often have
            a
            staple in them (as they appeared when used as actual POG bottlecaps), while modern commercial pogs were
            stiffer,
            thicker and are often printed with colorful glossy imagery.
    </P>
    <P>
        The other equipment that is used is a slammer: a heavier game piece often made of metal, rubber, or more
        commonly plastic, which come in various thicknesses and weights.[4] They are typically similar in diameter to
        milk caps. Metal slammers are not allowed in some games because they are usually heavier than other materials,
        giving the player with the first turn an unfair advantage, and have a tendency to damage the milk caps.
